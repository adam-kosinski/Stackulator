			<h4>Stackulator Project by Daequan and Adam</h4>
			Both of us started by researching how to style items in JavaFX. We found that there was support
			in JavaFX for using CSS, which Adam was familiar with. Together we played around to try to make
			things different colors, Adam fiddling around with the code and Daequan doing research. Eventually
			we figured out how to use the class and id methods of styling things, and got the background to turn
			red. At this point, Daequan suggested we use a teal and black color scheme. We spent a while trying
			to get the colors right. Adam figured out how to add linear gradients, and we added those to the buttons
			and the display to improve the appearance. We also added shadows to give a sense of depth to the
			calculator. There were a couple issues with things not lining up properly, which took a lot of fiddling
			to fix, especially with JavaFX's method of using CSS (e.g. width has to be specified with Java, not
			with CSS).
